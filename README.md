### Alex Kuphal's Portfolio

I'm a graduate of Bradley University with a degree in Data Science and I've been working for 8 months at Produce Pro Software, an ERP software for mid-large sized produce companies. After being trained I worked as a software devoloper for about 3 months before being able to move to the analytics department where I've been working the last 4 months as a professional services consultant. My daily responsibilities have mainly involved maintaining the data warehouses for the customers who use analytics which is about 60 businesses. In addition I continued doing a bit of software engineering for maintaining the programs that get the ETL files out of the ERP, as well as supporting the work that our customers our doing out of IBM Cognos. I also headed up the setup of internal analytics in Salesforce after we transitioned over in February. Overall I have a strong working background in data engineering, analytics, and reporting. Along with my projects performing data science in python, my experience in software development and degree in data science, I believe I'm a strong candidate to consider to help drive insights in your company.

I have included a variety of different projects here along with my resume and cover letter, so to make it easier to navigate I've tagged the projects by which field they're most relevent to. There's DS for Data Science, DE for Data Engineering, and DA for Data Analytics. I've also detailed the projects in each of the categories below their tags and all the files can be found in the akuphal repository


Data Science - DS

These files are a mix of projects that I've done in school and in my free time. They range in complexity from basic data analysis to using machine learning to build models The notebooks are fairly well commented and titled appropriately so feel free to explore those projects as they should be fairly self explanitory.


Data Engineering - DE

The majority of my experience in this field comes from my work at Produce Pro, which although it allows it to be one of my most practiced does not give me an ability to share many of the projects. To supliment that I've included a document going through in more details the projects I've worked on at Produce Pro, and a personal project that goes through setting up a router/server/client relationship in python.


Data Analytics - DA

This section is similar to the last in that the majority of my work in it has been done through produce pro but I do have more of an ability to share this since my salesforce work was an internal analytics project rather than one that belonged to a customer. I've included that project, along with a similar documennt to the data engineering section that goes through my data analytics job responsibilities at Produce Pro in a bit more detail.
