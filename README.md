### Alex Kuphal's Portfolio

I'm a graduate of Bradley University with a degree in Data Science and I've been working for 9 months at Produce Pro Software, an ERP software for mid-large sized produce companies. After being trained I worked as a software developer for about 3 months before being able to move to the analytics department where I've been working the last 5 months as a professional services consultant. My daily responsibilities have mainly involved maintaining the data warehouses for the customers who use analytics which is about 60 businesses. In addition, I continued doing a bit of software engineering for maintaining the programs that get the ETL files out of the ERP, as well as supporting the work that our customers our doing out of IBM Cognos. I also headed up the setup of internal analytics in Salesforce after we transitioned over in February. Overall, I have a strong working background in data engineering, analytics, and reporting. Along with my projects performing data science in python, my experience in software development and degree in data science, I believe I'm a strong candidate to consider to help drive insights in your company.

I have included a variety of different projects here along with my resume and cover letter, so to make it easier to navigate I've tagged the projects by which field they're most relevant to. There's DA for Data Analytics, DE for Data Engineering, and DS for Data Science. I've also detailed the projects in each of the categories below their tags and all the files can be found in the akuphal repository.


Data Analytics - DA

Since most of my experience in this field comes from my work at Produce Pro, I am limited in what I can share in this category. I do have the ability to share my Salesforce project since that work was an internal analytics project rather than one that belonged to a customer, so I've included a walkthrough of that project. I've also included a document that details the responsibilities of the analytics department at Produce Pro which also goes through a bit of my data engineering experience too.


Data Engineering - DE

As most of my experience in this field comes from my work at Produce Pro as well and I have less of an ability to share these projects, I have included a couple personal ones to supplement. The first goes through setting up a router/server/client relationship in python where all the components can be used to communicated with each other as a they do over the internet. The second project is looking at the effectiveness of my Pok√©mon Team in SQL server studio. I have 3 queries and screenshots of their outputs which goes through me joining my team to a table of overall stats, then joining the type matchup matrix to my team to create one for my team, and then summarizing that matrix to look at which types need more coverage.


Data Science - DS

These files are a mix of projects that I've done in school and in my free time. They range in complexity from basic data analysis to using machine learning to build models The notebooks are fairly well commented and titled appropriately so feel free to explore those projects as they should be fairly self-explanatory.
