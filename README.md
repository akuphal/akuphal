### Alex Kuphal's Portfolio

I'm a graduate of Bradley University with a degree in Data Science and I've been working for a year and a half at both Produce Pro and Aptean. I joined Produce Pro after their acquisition by Aptean and after a few months of being trained and spending some time with the general systems and accounting department, I joined the 2-man analytics team. My daily responsibilities revolved around maintaining the data warehouses for the approximately 60 businesses that used analytics, as well as supporting the work that the customers were doing out of IBM Cognos. In addition, I continued doing a bit of software development to maintain the programs that perform the ETL process out of the ERP. After about a year with Produce Pro I was brought onto the parent company to work on their BI solutions where I'm currently doing a very similar job but using Windows and Power BI instead of the Linux tools I was previously working with. My time in these positions has given me a strong working background in data engineering, analytics, and reporting and has allowed me apply it at an array of customers. With this variety of experiences so early on in my career and a desire to continue learning I believe I'm a strong candidate to consider to help build up your data analytics process in your company.

I have included a variety of different projects here along with my resume and cover letter, so to make it easier to navigate I've tagged the projects by which category they're most relevant to. There's DA for Data Analytics, DE for Data Engineering, and DS for Data Science. I've also provided some details on the projects in each of the categories below, and all the files can be found in the akuphal repository.


Data Analytics - DA

I’ve included a copy of my Salesforce project with the crucial information redacted so that I can walk you through my thought process in creating it. I've also included a document that goes into detail about my responsibilities in the analytics department at Produce Pro.


Data Engineering - DE

I have included a couple personal projects in this category. The first goes through setting up a router/server/client relationship in python where all the components can be used to communicated with each other as a they do over the internet. The second project is looking at the effectiveness of my Pokémon Team in SQL server studio. I have 3 queries and screenshots of their outputs which goes through joining a table for my team to a table of overall stats, then joining the type matchup matrix to my team, and then summarizing the outputs of that matrix to look at which types need more coverage. The document going over my responsibilities at produce pro contains some information from this category as well


Data Science - DS

These files are a mix of projects that I've done in school and in my free time. They range in complexity from basic data analysis to using machine learning to build models. The notebooks are fairly well commented and titled appropriately so feel free to explore those projects as they should be fairly self-explanatory.
